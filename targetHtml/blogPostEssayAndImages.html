						<h1>ALOHA</h1>
						<p>The Aloha network laid the groundwork for developing wireless protocols and even influenced Ethernet.</p>

					<p>One of the early computer networking designs, development of the ALOHA network was begun in 1968 at the 
					University of Hawaii under the leadership of Norman Abramson and others (including Frank Kuo, N. Gaarder and 
					N. Weldon). The goal was to use low-cost commercial radio equipment to connect users on Oahu and the other 
					Hawaiian islands with a central time-sharing computer on the main Oahu campus. The original version of ALOHA
					used two distinct frequencies in a hub/star configuration, with the hub machine broadcasting packets to 
					everyone on the "outbound" channel, and the various client machines sending data packets to the hub on 
					the "inbound" channel. If data was received correctly at the hub, a short acknowledgment packet was sent to
					the client; if an acknowledgment was not received by a client machine after a short wait time, it would 
					automatically retransmit the data packet after waiting a randomly selected time interval. This acknowledgment
					mechanism was used to detect and correct for "collisions" created when two client machines both attempted to 
					send a packet at the same time.</p>

					<p>Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) is a specification (or standard) that automates the mapping between
					 XML documents and Java objects and vice versa. One of the primary components of JAXB is the schema compiler. 
					 The schema compiler is the tool used to generate Java bindings from an XML schema document. If used in its default 
					 mode (for non-trivial applications), the compiler usually generates bindings that are awkward to work with. This 
					 article will look at various methods you can use to customize the generated bindings.</p>

					<p>It is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge 
					path costs, producing a shortest path tree. This algorithm is often used in routing as a subroutine in other graph 
					algorithms, or in GPS technology.  For a given source vertex (node) in the graph, the algorithm finds the path 
					with lowest cost (i.e. the shortest path) between that vertex and every other vertex. It can also be used for 
					finding costs of shortest paths from a single vertex to a single destination vertex by stopping the algorithm once 
					the shortest path to the destination vertex has been determined.</p>

					<p>A drawing of a graph or network diagram is a pictorial representation of the vertices and edges of a graph. This 
					drawing should not be confused with the graph itself: very different layouts can correspond to the same graph.[2] 
					In the abstract, all that matters is which pairs vertices are connected by edges. In the concrete, however, the 
					arrangement of these vertices and edges within a drawing affects its understandability, usability, fabrication cost,
					 and aesthetics</p>
