Theme Usage Notes:
--------
### Image Size
Use Media Settings to set maximum image size to 650px. This limit is enforced by the theme in order to maintain structure.  Larger images will be resized, resulting in poor page load performance.

### 404 Page
There is a widget area for the 404 page named "404 Text Widget". This can be used to display a custom message to users by adding a text widget onto this widget-area.

### Navigation
These buttons are implemented as menu-items of a Custom Menu.  You'll need to create a menu then you'll see the option to set that menu as the navigation menu.  It is called "Header Navigation".

### Footer Widget
There is only one widget area for this theme and it is a very small space that should contain a footer message such as contact information or copyright information (in a Text Widget) or a small widget such as "Meta".  Otherwise the widget will overlap the header and look very wrong.  Also note that the widget's title is not shown (hidden by CSS).

### Search
The search bar is hard-coded into the top-right area of the page at full-width.

### Meta Description
This can be added in the Theme Options page.
