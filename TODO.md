+ + Then *(low priority)*


### High Priority:
+ add href to blog title at: 
+ + .masterHeader h1
+ implement page.php

+ + appears in center instead of aligned to the left margin
+ fix search input position on <= 550px-width display

+ + then if so, load google-code-prettifier JS, etc...
+ design CLI output style

+ + when active change gray to black/transparent?

+ + NOTE: consider the default font size of major browsers beforehand	

### Low Priority:
+ adopt / devise framebusting strategy
+ make IE upgrade banner dismissable (add an X to close)
+ and set and check for a cookie so we don't further irritate by that message
+ investigate / research:
+ + Pingback Url
+ + Microformats
+ + + http://gmpg.org/xfn/11
+ + + other?

### Future:
+ include a screenshot.png in distributable *(when complete)*
+ cut a branch for version 2:
+ + configurable quantity of nav buttons
+ + easily configurable color scheme (WP inputs for the 2 or 3 colors actually used)
