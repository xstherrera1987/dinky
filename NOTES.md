### Code Prettifier

For blog posts / pages with source code use

    <code class="prettyprint">

to enable google-code-prettify syntax highlighting.  Proper formatting with <code> < br /> </code> is still necessary and it is probably best to use 2 spaces per indent level.

eg:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;var indented = ...;
