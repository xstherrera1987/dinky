Dinky Wordpress Theme
---------------------

### *Theme Usage Notes:*

### Code Prettifier

For blog posts / pages with source code use

    <code class="prettyprint">

to enable google-code-prettify syntax highlighting.  Proper formatting with <code> < br /> </code> is still necessary and it is probably best to use 2 spaces per indent level.

eg:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;var indented = ...;

### Image Size
Use Media Settings to set maximum image size to 650px. This limit is enforced by the theme in order to maintain structure.  Larger images will be resized, resulting in poor page load performance.
